## Maze Generator
## Wilson's Loop Erased Random Walk Algorithm
## Author: CaptainFlint

"""
Wilson's Algorithm is an algorithm to generate a
uniform spanning tree using a loop erased random walk.
Algorithm:
1. Choose a random cell and add it to the visited list
2. Choose another random cell (Don’t add to visited list).
   This is the current cell.
3. Choose a random cell that is adjacent to the current cell
   (Don’t add to visited list). This is your new current cell.
4. Save the direction that you traveled on the previous cell.
5. If the current cell is not in the visited cells list:
   a. Go to 3
6. Else:
   a. Starting at the cell selected in step 2, follow the arrows
      and remove the edges that are crossed.
   b. Add all cells that are passed into the visited list
7. If all cells have not been visited
   a. Go to 2
